            <h1>The Vine Rules</h1>

            <p>Our goal is to provide a service that allows you to discover and receive content from sources that
                interest you as well as to share your content with others. We respect the ownership of the content that
                users share and each user is responsible for the content he or she provides. Because of these
                principles, we do not actively monitor user content and will not censor user content, except in limited
                circumstances described below.</p>

            <h2>Content Boundaries and Use of Vine</h2>

            <p>In order to provide the Vine service and the ability to communicate and stay connected with others, there
                are some limitations on the type of content that may be published with Vine. These limitations comply
                with legal requirements and make Vine a better experience for all. Vine may update or modify the Content
                Boundaries of Use from time to time by posting the changes on this site.</p>

                    unless it is provided by Vine. Accounts using these badges as part of profile photos or in a way

            <h2>Spam and Abuse</h2>

            <p>Vine strives to protect its users from spam and abuse. Technical abuse and user abuse are not tolerated
                on Vine and may result in permanent suspension.</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="major"><strong>Serial Accounts:</strong> You may not create serial accounts for disruptive or
                    abusive purposes, or with overlapping use cases. Mass account creation may result in suspension of
                    all related accounts.
                </li>

                <li class="major"><strong>Profile URL Squatting:</strong> You may not engage in profile URL squatting.
                    Accounts that are inactive for more than six months may also have their profile URLs removed or
                    reclaimed without further notice. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining
                    what conduct is considered to be profile URL squatting are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the number of profile URLs created;</li>
                        <li>creating profile URLs for the purpose of preventing others from using those profile URL
                            names;
                        </li>
                        <li>creating profile URLs for the purpose of selling those profile URLs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li class="major"><strong>Invitation spam:</strong> You may not use any of the “Find People” (address
                    book contact importer, Twitter contact importer, invite via email, and invite via text) or “Share”
                    features to send repeat, mass invitations.
                </li>

                <li class="major"><strong>Selling accounts:</strong> You may not purchase or sell Vine accounts.</li>

                <li class="major"><strong>Malware/Phishing:</strong> You may not publish or link to malicious content
                    intended to damage or disrupt another user’s browser or computer, or to compromise a user’s privacy
                    or login information.
                </li>

                <li class="major"><strong>Spam:</strong> You may not use the Vine service for the purpose of spamming
                    anyone. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to
                    be spamming are:

                                    or service, particularly if the service advertised is in the business of
                                    buying/selling account interactions (followers, “Likes”, etc);
                                </li>
                                <li>If you post Vine videos with deliberately misleading tags or channels;</li>

                                <li>If you “Like” a large number of Vine videos in an attempt to attract attention to a
