    	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">Lightweight markup languages</a> are typically all-or-nothing, but most 
    	use cases require only a subset of the language. This leads to numerous forks and flavors and ultimately confuses the end-user. Koara is a modular 
    	lightweight markup language (based on a <a href="grammar.html">formal grammar</a>) where every part of the syntax can be enabled/disabled. If the syntax is disabled, it will 
    	just render as plain text.</p>
