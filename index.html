This leads to numerous forks and flavors and ultimately confuses the end-user. Koara is a modular lightweight markup language (based on a <a href="grammar.html">formal grammar</a>) where every part of the syntax can be enabled/disabled. If the syntax is disabled, it will just render as plain text.</p><h1>Documentation</h1><ul><li><a href="#paragraphs">Paragraphs</a></li><li><a href="#headings">Headings</a></li></ul><h2 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h2><p>When enabled, any block of text that is not a heading, list, blockquote or codeblock is considered a paragraph. Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines. Newline characters are translated to linebreaks. Whitespace before or after the text is trimmed.</p><pre><code class="language-markup">This is a simple paragraph.

If a line should not be rendered as a heading, you can escape it by using a backslash. (you can also escape <code>*, `, \, -, ., >, [, (, &lt;, ], ), _</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-markup">= Heading 1
